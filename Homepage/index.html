            <p>
                I'm a Game Design & Development major hoping to someday be able to create my 
                own card, board, and video games. I'm also a member of the Hearthstone team
                here at RIT and I spend a lot of my free time playing that game. Recently, I
                attended a major international tournament and finished in the top 32! When I 
                graduate, I hope to be able to land a job at a noteable gaming studio. Becoming
                a card designer for Hearthstone would be the dream, but I'll settle for a bit
                less at first.
